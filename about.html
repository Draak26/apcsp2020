<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Owen Rathmell. I am 16 and enjoy marching band and playing games with my family. I take private drumming lessons from our drum tech at my school. My goals for the school year are to get good enough grades to raise my gpa to a 3.5, and a personal goal that I have is to get better at playing tenors in marching band, and to become the section leader for drumline next year. I am currently watching a show called Preacher on Hulu. It is very violent and is kind of strange. I like to listen to dubstep and twenty one pilots.</p>
